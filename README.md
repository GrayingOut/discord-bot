# Discord Bot

This is a simple bot application for discord that I am using to test features and experiment.
It is not meant to be used in an actual server, but feel free to use.

The bot requires the `ADMINISTRATOR` permission to function properly.

## Features
- Slash command support
- Hello command
- Warning system (guild specific)
    - Warn member
    - Remove warning
    - Clear warnings
    - List warnings
- Bulk deletion
- Slowmode
- Rules command (used to print a pretty embed) - edit code to customise
- Persistence with sqlite
